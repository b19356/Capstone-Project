## *“Introduction to Data Science”* Capstone Project Proposal

### Background

Under President Obama, the federal government initiated an effort to unveil the secrecy behind health-care charges.  Specifically, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has published information about inpatient hospital charges and associated reimbursements for Medicare beneficiaries spanning fiscal years 2011 – 2016.  The data shows wildly different hospital charges for the same procedures, even in similar geographic regions, further amplifying the confusion ([1](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html),[2]( http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170831/NEWS/170839968)).  Some public sources have developed guides to help consumers identify the most cost-effective route for treatment based on CMS reports ([3](http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/08/business/how-much-hospitals-charge.html)).

Although the data reflect charges after claim resolution, the American Hospital Association (AHA) has protested that the charges do not accurately reveal what consumers are charged because they do not contain updated information after further negotiations with insurance companies ([2]( http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170831/NEWS/170839968)).  The government, however, is not privy to insurance information, nor is it shared among hospitals.  Assuming the AHA is correct, then the consumer guides stemming from CMS reports are misleading.

Like the government, the AHA states they are committed to providing greater transparency and want to publish accurate information about their charges ([4](https://www.aha.org/issue-brief/2018-05-04-hospital-price-transparency)).  One of the primary challenges is that insurance companies do not want to reveal their charges and reimbursements.
