## *“Introduction to Data Science”* Capstone Project Proposal

# Background

Under President Obama, the federal government initiated an effort to unveil the secrecy behind health-care charges.  Specifically, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has published information about inpatient hospital charges and associated reimbursements for Medicare beneficiaries spanning fiscal years 2011 – 2016.  The data shows wildly different hospital charges for the same procedures, even in similar geographic regions, further amplifying the confusion [1](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html),[2]( http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170831/NEWS/170839968).  Some public sources have developed guides to help consumers identify the most cost-effective route for treatment based on CMS reports [3](http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/08/business/how-much-hospitals-charge.html).
