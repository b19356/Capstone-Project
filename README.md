## *“Introduction to Data Science”* Capstone Project Proposal

#Background

Under President Obama, the federal government initiated an effort to unveil the secrecy behind health-care charges.  Specifically, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has published information about inpatient hospital charges and associated reimbursements for Medicare beneficiaries spanning fiscal years 2011 – 2016.  The data shows wildly different hospital charges for the same procedures, even in similar geographic regions, further amplifying the confusion (1,2).  Some public sources have developed guides to help consumers identify the most cost-effective route for treatment based on CMS reports (3).
